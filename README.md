# About
This project is about various functional apps implementing different criteries like post redirection,django frameworks generics, get and post request, implementing authentication and authorization,data modeling like one to many , many to many,Ajax implementation for loading data from server without page refresh,Json serializer and deserializer implementation, jquery and more.  
It was done by me to get four certificates from University of Michigan about Django Framework.
It wasn't easy to complete took me some time though I could have ended it sooner.
Whatever,  
If you know django you know How to run it in venv or pipenv shell :).
